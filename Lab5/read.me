Lab 5: Page/Offset Calculation

5/3/2020
	Started and completed Lab 5 in one day!
	It was a simple program that required understanding how to calculate the page and
	offset based on the virtual memory address.
	There were two ways I could have done this.
	1) By just doing the math
	2) Using masking to cover the unneeded bits from the address.
	I went with the 1st choice.
